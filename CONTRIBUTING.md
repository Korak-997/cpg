# Contributing

In order to make contributions to my project as simple as possible.
I will not put a lot of rules here :)

-------------------------------------

## As long as your contribution goes with the flow of the Tool i will accept it happily :D

------------------------------------

## Few notes to remember :

* All **PRs** will be welcomed in dev branch.
  The reason for that is i want to keep **Master** branch stable.
  And i will make changes myself in **beta** branch.
  So to keep the codebase clean the **PRs** will only be accepted when they are made to **dev branch**

* Make your commits as small as possible.
  It would be much easier to understand what are you trying to do.
  Or if your suggestions are suitable. When your commit messages are small.
  Finish one thing ( a method maybe !) commit it then work on another one.

* Please do not commit unfinished codes !
* Make **PRs** when your things are all finished.
* If you use an Icon or anything like that . I need to see the **license** for it before merging your **PRs** . Just add a link to the **License** in your **PR** comment.
